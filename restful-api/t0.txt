asics of HTTP/HTTPS

Differences Between HTTP and HTTPS

HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol) is the standard protocol used for communication between web clients and servers. It allows browsers to send requests and receive responses.

However, HTTP transmits data in plain text. This means that anyone intercepting the communication can read or modify the data.

HTTPS (HyperText Transfer Protocol Secure) is the secure version of HTTP. It uses SSL/TLS encryption to protect the data exchanged between the client and the server.

Main differences:

HTTP is not encrypted.

HTTPS encrypts data using SSL/TLS.

HTTP uses port 80.

HTTPS uses port 443.

HTTPS requires a digital certificate.

HTTPS ensures confidentiality, integrity, and authentication.

Structure of an HTTP Request

An HTTP request has three main parts:

Request Line
Format: METHOD PATH HTTP_VERSION
Example:
GET /index.html HTTP/1.1

Headers

Examples:

Structure of an HTTP Response

An HTTP response also has three parts:

Status Line
Format: HTTP_VERSION STATUS_CODE STATUS_MESSAGE

Response Headers
Examples:

Content-Length: 1200

Body
